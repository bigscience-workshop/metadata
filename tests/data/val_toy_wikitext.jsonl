{"text":" Homarus gammarus is a large crustacean , with a body length up to 60 centimetres ( 24 in ) and weighing up to 5 \u2013 6 kilograms ( 11 \u2013 13 lb ) , although the lobsters caught in lobster pots are usually 23 \u2013 38 cm ( 9 \u2013 15 in ) long and weigh 0 @.@ 7 \u2013 2 @.@ 2 kg ( 1 @.@ 5 \u2013 4 @.@ 9 lb ) . Like other crustaceans , lobsters have a hard exoskeleton which they must shed in order to grow , in a process called ecdysis ( moulting ) . This may occur several times a year for young lobsters , but decreases to once every 1 \u2013 2 years for larger animals . \n"}
{"text":" The first pair of pereiopods is armed with a large , asymmetrical pair of claws . The larger one is the \" crusher \" , and has rounded nodules used for crushing prey ; the other is the \" cutter \" , which has sharp inner edges , and is used for holding or tearing the prey . Usually , the left claw is the crusher , and the right is the cutter . \n"}
{"text":" The exoskeleton is generally blue above , with spots that coalesce , and yellow below . The red colour associated with lobsters only appears after cooking . This occurs because , in life , the red pigment astaxanthin is bound to a protein complex , but the complex is broken up by the heat of cooking , releasing the red pigment . \n"}
{"text":" The closest relative of H. gammarus is the American lobster , Homarus americanus . The two species are very similar , and can be crossed artificially , although hybrids are unlikely to occur in the wild since their ranges do not overlap . The two species can be distinguished by a number of characteristics : \n"}
{"text":" The rostrum of H. americanus bears one or more spines on the underside , which are lacking in H. gammarus . \n"}
{"text":" The spines on the claws of H. americanus are red or red @-@ tipped , while those of H. gammarus are white or white @-@ tipped . \n"}
{"text":" The underside of the claw of H. americanus is orange or red , while that of H. gammarus is creamy white or very pale red . \n"}
